CSS lecture 1: 
3 ways to connect css 
1. Internal CSS: This is when you put the CSS in the HTML document. This is not
recommended because it can get messy and hard to read.
2. External CSS: This is when you put the CSS in a separate file. This is the
recommended way to do it because it keeps the HTML and CSS separate and makes
it easier to read and maintain.
3. Inline CSS: This is when you put the CSS directly in the HTML element. This
is not recommended because it can get messy and hard to read.
